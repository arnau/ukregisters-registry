datatype: polygon
text: A 2 dimensional geographic boundary expressed as a [GeoJSON Polygon](http://geojson.org/geojson-spec.html#polygon). A polygon is a JSON array of linear rings. The first ring represents the enclosing boundary, with the following rings describing holes within the enclosing boundary. A linier ring is a JSON array of geograhic points, with each point represented as an array of longitude, latitude points, each of which is a [decimal-degrees]() value in the [WGS84](http://spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/wgs-84/) datum. A field containing a series of polygons will be serialsed in a format compatible with the [PostGIS AsGeoJSON](http://postgis.org/docs/ST_AsGeoJSON.html) format.
